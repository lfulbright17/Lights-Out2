Prologue:

At night, while walking down the lonely sidewalk to your house, you notice farther down the street is your neighbor, Ms. Light, sitting alone on a sidewalk bench. You always felt sorry for the old woman (she looked about a hundred years old), because she&apos;s both blind and a widow. You don&apos;t know much else about her. Everyone in town knows she&apos;s crazy, though. She hardly leaves her house after all, which made her being there even more strange. Ms. Light doesn&apos;t have any friends, and she is always singing a disturbing song quietly to herself.

You walk as quitely as possible to not disturb her (she is singing again). When, all of a sudden, Ms. Light stops singing and turns her head slowly in your direction, acknowledging you. She can hear you from over 30 meters away! Maybe she can smell you? Or maybe she can sense your presence, and knows that you had tried to avoid her? Whatever it is, you had to admit that Ms. Light&apos;s ESP is more than a little creepy.

Before you could even say anything, Ms. Light rises from her bench, and strides towards you at a startling pace. Once she in in considerable distance from you (much too close for your own comfort), she utters in a low, scratchy voice, &quot;Ah, I&apos;ve been waiting for you. I&apos;m going out of town tomorrow night, and I need you to watch my house for me...




Lights Out
An Interactive Fiction by Lee-Won Fulbright
Release 1 / Serial number 141007 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

ms light&apos;s driveway
You were in need of a little bit of cash, and, though you were hesitant, agreed to house-sit for a surprisingly generous amount of money while Ms. Light is out of town. It&apos;s weird though, hardly anyone travels this time of year, and Ms. Light is the last person you&apos;d think would want to get out of town.

It&apos;s storming tonight. You are currently getting rained on. Better get out of the rain right away. You should take a quick look at Ms. Light&apos;s house for the first time.

Entrance-Room
 You have opened the front door and are in the house&apos;s first room. You turn on the light-switch, but the lights fail to come on. You realize that the power must have gone out sometime during the storm! It&apos;s too dark to see*, so you can&apos;t tell what&apos;s in the room or what it is used for. You need to find a way to turn the lights back on.

You know that in every house in your neighborhood there is usually a basement containing a back-up generator for power outages during storms like this one. If you can find the generator, it should be fairly simple to get the power back on. However, there might be a code or password needed to activate it.




*NOTE: It is very important to understand that the house is completely dark. You will not be able to obtain all clues and have a full game experience unless you use ALL/MOST OF YOUR SENSES to interact with each thing/room. Also: While it is possible to &quot;smell&quot; or &quot;listen to&quot; a room without specifying object, you cannot &quot;feel&quot; a room. You must &quot;feel&quot; or &quot;touch&quot; specified objects within a room. Smells and sounds of objects can also be different from the room they are located in.

You know that  North is North-Room and East is East-Room. South is Ms. Light&apos;s Driveway.

Entrance-Room
You have opened the front door and are in the house&apos;s first room. As you reach to the side of the door for the lights and flip the switch, you realize that the power must have gone out sometime during the storm. It&apos;s too dark to see, so you can&apos;t tell what the purpose of the room is. You need to find a way to turn the lights back on.

You know that in every house in your neighborhood there is usually a basement containing a back-up generator for power outages during storms like this one. If you can find the generator, it should be fairly simple to get the power back on. However, there might be a code or password needed to activate it.

For now, you can try navigate your way through the house by going North and East.
